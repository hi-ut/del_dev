title: Dai Nihon Shiryo (Chronological Source Books of Japanese History)
---

The Dai Nihon Shiryo series is an ongoing and comprehensive attempt to cover all major events mentioned in the existing records between the years 887 and 1867. The starting date corresponds with the date when the ancient Japanese state abandoned compilation of official histories, and 1867 corresponds with the last year of Tokugawa rule. Publications of these historical sources are divided into sixteen parts or periods with multiple volumes in each part. The Institute has also published a 17-volume guide to Dai Nihon Shiryo entitled Shiryo Soran. It lists all materials from 887 to 1639, including unpublished volumes of Dai Nihon Shiryo.
