title: Dai Nihon Ishin Shiryo (Historical Materials of the Meiji Restoration)
---

This series originated in another research institute located within the Ministry of Education that focused exclusively on the Meiji Restoration. Copies of materials were arranged chronologically in over 4,200 volumes covering the years 1846 to 1871. Publication ceased with the dissolution of the institute in 1949. The Historiographical Institute was asked to resume work on documents related to the Meiji Restoration, and currently chronological materials are being prepared directly onto microfilm. The special part of the collection focuses on the Ii family document collection.
