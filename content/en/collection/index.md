The Historiographical Institute has an extensive collection of documents, diaries, and other historical materials, including a National Treasure and designated Important Cultural Properties. The Institute also maintains an up-to-date collection of modern scholarly monographs and academic journals related to Japanese history. All of these items are cared for and managed by the Institute's Library.

A wide variety of materials can be accessed in the Institute library. These include original documents, replicas, photo reproductions, microfilm and sheet-film copies, and CD-ROM materials. The Institute is particularly proud of its strong collection of original materials, acquired over the years through gifts, purchase, and government designation. In addition, all of the tools needed for research on Japanese historical materials can be found in the library, including general and specialized reference works, as well as books and journals in Japanese and Western languages.

To encourage historical studies both within and outside of the university, the library lists many of its holdings with several Internet database search services, including OPAC (the database of books and journals held in the University of Tokyo) and CiNii (a compilation site for libraries throughout Japan), and HI-cat (Historiographical Institute Catalog). Library staff can assist with reference questions and in special cases prepare photographic reproductions (shashincho) of some materials.

The Institute's library welcomes scholars who wish to use the collections for their research, though certain restrictions apply.

<h2 class="h03 mt-10">Collection</h2>

The Institute's collection includes many rare and unique items. Among them there are one item of National Treasure (kokuho) and sixteen items of Important Cultural Properties (juyo bunkazai), that have been designated by the Cultural Affairs Agency. Also there are sixty-three special collections, and many other particularly fragile and valuable historical materials. Such items receive special attention at the Institute, including storage in special shelves made of cypress wood to limit light exposure and inhibit insects. For items which are in high demand, photographic reproductions have been created to minimize wear on the original materials. Please contact the Library for further information.
