In 1793, Hanawa Hokiichi, a scholar of \"National Learning\" (kokugaku) proposed to the Tokugawa bakufu that his Institute for Japanese Studies (Wagaku Kodansho) begin compiling historical records. By 1861, Hanawa's institute produced 430 volumes of source books covering the years 887 to 1024. The starting year 887 was chosen because it was the last year of the ancient Japanese governmental histories. The manuscripts compiled by Hanawa's institute became the basis for the project called Dai Nihon Shiryo, which continues at the Historiographical Institute to the present day. In 1869 the new Meiji government established a new bureau to compile an official national history of Japan that would take up where the ancient official histories left off, and in 1876 the new bureau began to compile historical records using Hanawa's methods; in 1882, the bureau started to write an official history based on the documents it had collected. This official history was abandoned in 1893, but the compilation of source materials continued and led to the publication of the first volume of the Dai Nihon Shiryo series in 1901."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Although the Historiographical Office was originally located within the government, in 1888 its researchers were transferred to the Imperial University, the predecessor of the University of Tokyo.

While searching for an appropriate system for compiling an official history in the 1870s, the Institute asked the Hungarian historian George Gustavus Zerffi to explain Western historical methodology; in response, he wrote his book, The Science of History (1879). Between 1887 and 1902, the German historian Ludwig Riess, an advocate of Rankean history-as-science, taught at the university. He emphasized that the university's research and teaching needed to be coordinated with the compilation of historical materials, a view that substantially influenced the early development of the Institute. In 1893, the growing realization that the purpose of modern historical studies should be to allow the people to interpret the past for themselves, while the state's role should be to make source materials available rather than write an official history, led to the decision to abandon the project to create an official history."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"The Institute's mission has continued to expand.

In 1997, the Institute established the Center for the Study of Visual Sources, to handle the special challenges of collecting and interpreting pictorial or illustrated materials as historical sources.
